# Text_Preprocessing_NLP
 
This repository contains the code that shows basic steps followed to perform text pre-processing in NLP.

The text is fetched from the URL: https://talesoftravels2405.wordpress.com/2018/04/08/hampi-the-forgotten-kingdom/
(From my own blog on Hampi) :)

Following steps are then performed to preprocess and clean the text and a word cloud of 100 words is then generated:

1. Remove HTML tags from the text
2. Tokenize
3. Lower Casing
4. Stopword Removal
5. Remove Punctuation
6. Remove Spaces
7. Remove Numbers
8. Word Cloud
