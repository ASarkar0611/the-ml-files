The data from the files are pre-processed, explored and then trained to generate prediction models. The data exploration is done using Matplotlib and Seaborn library in Python. 

Following models are trained to predict on the test data:

1. Linear Regression
2. Random Forest Regression
3. Gradient Boosted Trees
4. Decision Tree Regressor
